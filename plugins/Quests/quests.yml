    name: Explore the area around Spawn
    ask-message: Hey! Why not get a little bit familiar with this world? You ready
      to explore the surrounding area?
    finish-message: Great! You have explored the area around Spawn! You visited Templeside
      Village and said hello to the mayor. You trudged across the Noryn desert, smelled
      the Soundless Swamp, saw the north side of Marasor Woods and came back to Spawn
      via the South road. Then you gazed at the great Mt. Clarenburn and came to the
      center of The Shield.
