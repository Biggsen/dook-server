    name: Explore the area around Spawn
    ask-message: Hey! Why not get a little bit familiar with this world? You ready
      to explore the surrounding area?
    finish-message: Great! You have explored the area around Spawn! You visited Templeside

      the Soundless Swamp, saw the north side of Marasor Woods and came back to Spawn
      via the South road. Then you gazed at the great Mt. Clarenburn and came to the
      center of The Shield.

            a broken portal somewhat close to them. These portal used to be connected

            bringing prosperity and closeness. With a portalstone these portals can
            be connected again! Each village has committed $10,000 to the cause, making
