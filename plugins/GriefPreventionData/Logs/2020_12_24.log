21:08 vanism    : hey Zonelesi!
21:09 vanism    : welcome back yourself :)
21:09 Zonelesi  : Thank you :D I needed a break
21:09 vanism    : yea fair
21:15 vanism    : I fixed the back on death issue
21:16 Zonelesi  : I noticed, thank you for the fix
21:16 vanism    : that wasn't working properly
21:18 Zonelesi  : It's pretty empty now.
21:19 vanism    : yep
21:19 Zonelesi  : It's kinda the same as the first time I joined though
21:22 vanism    : I don't mind it quiet. gives me time to fine tune and explore.
21:22 Zonelesi  : I understand that :)
21:23 vanism    : I pre generated all chunks in a 5000 diameter circle
21:23 Zonelesi  : dang, that's a lot.
21:23 vanism    : server should be healthy.
21:23 vanism    : also modified the villager trading.
21:23 Zonelesi  : What's different?
21:24 vanism    : well, they only work between 8-5. Not available outside of those hours.
21:24 vanism    : I've also fixed the prices for the enchanted books.
21:25 Zonelesi  : More expensive?
21:25 vanism    : not possible to get Mending for 1 emerald for example.
21:25 vanism    : yes. the rare ones
21:26 vanism    : there's now an enchanted books price list and the traders work from that
21:27 vanism    : 8
21:27 Zonelesi  : 8 emeralds minimum for mending?
21:28 vanism    : 23 emeralds.
21:28 Zonelesi  : Not bad
21:34 Zonelesi  :  placed a sign @ world: x-418, z-1254
  Temporary

22:02 Zonelesi  : Welcome back
22:02 vanism    : ty :)
22:29 Zonelesi  : You said you had previous servers, right?
22:30 vanism    : yes I had a few, just tryingthings out
22:31 Zonelesi  : I'm just worried that this server may stop at some point
22:32 vanism    : the smaller server almost always do. it's a chance you take.
22:33 Zonelesi  : I guess that's true, maybe when this server does meet it's time. May I have a copy of this world?
22:33 vanism    : oh yes I don't see why not.
22:33 Zonelesi  : I appreciate your kindness.
22:33 vanism    : I'm keeping this going as long as I can.
22:33 Zonelesi  : You're doing good at it
22:34 vanism    : I think so. learning loads.
22:34 vanism    : the whole community thing is new and a bit weird.
22:35 Zonelesi  : You have more guts than I have, that's for sure :)
22:36 vanism    : what I really really wanna do is quests and stuff
22:36 vanism    : more rpg-y things
22:36 Zonelesi  : That'd be pretty cool!
22:36 vanism    : but they way I wanna do it needs a lot of planning.
22:37 Zonelesi  : I'll be looking forward to it :D
22:37 vanism    : nice :)
22:38 Zonelesi  : I just hope I don't die on the first day
22:38 vanism    : oh and I found a really sweet portal plugin
22:38 Zonelesi  : What does it do?
22:38 vanism    : you make portals between place a and b.
22:39 vanism    : instead of having player tp, it'll be custom portals around the world.
22:40 Zonelesi  : So it's for individual players?
22:40 vanism    : you want to try it?
22:40 Zonelesi  : Sure
22:41 vanism    : ok hold on. I need to install it.
22:46 Zonelesi  : Alright.
23:04 Zonelesi  : Okay
23:09 vanism    : Welcome
23:09 Zonelesi  : Thank you :)
23:10 vanism    : ok go mine. we need to find a portal stone.
23:10 vanism    : they can be found in redstone ore
23:11 Zonelesi  : Alright
23:15 vanism    : got one
23:16 vanism    : have you got obsidian?
23:16 Zonelesi  : No
23:16 vanism    : ok. you need obsidian as well.
23:17 vanism    : I've only got 4 so I'm gonna get some too
23:17 vanism    : enough to make a nether portal basically
23:18 Zonelesi  : Oh, right
23:20 Zonelesi  : Does fortune affect redstone ore?
23:20 vanism    : yep think so
23:20 Zonelesi  : Oh! I found one
23:20 vanism    : nice!
23:32 vanism    : ok. I've now built a portal close to my place.
23:32 vanism    : this portal will take me to your place.
23:32 Zonelesi  : Alright
23:32 vanism    : so we'll be able to connect our bases.
23:32 Zonelesi  : So an alliance?
23:33 vanism    : hehe sure
23:33 Zonelesi  : So do I put my redstone in?
23:33 vanism    : so, have you built a nether portal?
23:34 Zonelesi  : Yeah
23:34 vanism    : the one which will lead to my base?
23:34 Zonelesi  : Mhm
23:34 vanism    : ok cool. light up the portal with flint and steel
23:34 Zonelesi  : Alright, done
23:34 vanism    : ok. now throw the portal stone at the portal
23:35 vanism    : it should bounce back

23:35 vanism    : give me the portal stone
23:35 vanism    : ok. I'm gonna bind it to mine
23:36 vanism    : ok meet me at spawn again
