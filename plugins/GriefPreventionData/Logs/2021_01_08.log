17:29 Zonelesi  : Welcome back verzion
17:29 Bl4zeBoy  : hi verzion!
17:29 verzion   : ty
17:29 Bl4zeBoy  :  placed a sign @ world: x-470, z-1479
  Hello verzion
17:29 Bl4zeBoy  :  placed a sign @ world: x-470, z-1479
  I know you can
  see this
17:29 verzion   : lol
17:30 Bl4zeBoy  :  placed a sign @ world: x-470, z-1479
  I know all about
  your plugins
17:30 verzion   : really?
17:30 Bl4zeBoy  :  placed a sign @ world: x-470, z-1479
  Like harbor is a
  sleep plugin!
17:30 Zonelesi  : ?
17:30 Bl4zeBoy  :  placed a sign @ world: x-470, z-1479
  I thought it was
  better boats xD
17:30 verzion   : Blaze talking to me via signs
17:30 Zonelesi  : Ah
17:30 verzion   : I need to learn how to hide the plugin list
17:31 Zonelesi  : Why?
17:31 Bl4zeBoy  : add the plugin luckperms
17:31 verzion   : to make exploiting slightly harder
17:31 verzion   : I got lp
17:31 Bl4zeBoy  : wait don't you already have luckperms?
17:32 Bl4zeBoy  : oh, well it might be easy?
17:32 verzion   : I guess. configuring is often easy, but not always obvious
17:32 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion is it allowed to use fullbright?
17:32 verzion   : isn't that just a lighting thing?
17:32 Bl4zeBoy  : it's basically night vision
17:32 verzion   : yes it's fine
17:33 Bl4zeBoy  : ok cool
17:33 verzion   : you can do it also in video settings, brightness
17:34 verzion   : to the max
17:34 verzion   : (not exactly the same I guess, but works)
17:34 Bl4zeBoy  : to make it so that people can't see the plugin list go into the permissions and search for the name like bukkit plugins list or something and set it to false, maybe
17:34 Bl4zeBoy  : also why isn't my lawn growing I've left it for days
17:34 Zonelesi  : Optifine is similar, when you hold a torch, it lights up a bit around you
17:35 Bl4zeBoy  : yeah dynamic light
17:35 Bl4zeBoy  : the main reason i got optifine was for the connected glass textures
17:35 Bl4zeBoy  : not for anything else
17:35 verzion   : try now
17:36 Zonelesi  : I got optifine because of the cute mob models texture pack
17:36 Bl4zeBoy  : not allowed to
17:36 verzion   : hah!
17:36 Bl4zeBoy  : perfect
17:36 Zonelesi  : Why am I not allowed to /afk?
17:36 Bl4zeBoy  : because we're ordinarys
17:36 Zonelesi  : Zombie not doing damage???
17:36 verzion   : no one is yet. I might add it to the perks list
17:37 Zonelesi  : Why is it not damaging me!?
17:37 verzion   : can I tp?
17:37 Bl4zeBoy  : Zonelesi we're not allowed to afk because we're ordinarys
17:37 Zonelesi  : sure but its burning
17:37 Zonelesi  : Alright then
17:37 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion am i allowed to construct an anti AFK machine without getting banned?
17:38 Zonelesi  : Was it the wood?
17:38 verzion   : no clue
17:38 verzion   : what is an anti AFK machine?
17:38 Bl4zeBoy  : basically i make like a special water stream that keeps me moving and i won't get disconnected for afk
17:39 verzion   : I generally frown on gaming the system
17:40 Bl4zeBoy  : but if im not always at my base my grass won't grow
17:40 verzion   : then your grass won't grow
17:41 Bl4zeBoy  : oh wait i have a silk touch shovel
17:41 Zonelesi  : lol
17:41 Zonelesi  : You could also just buy grass from the sh-
17:41 verzion   : ah, yes get a handful of grass block and sprinkle
17:42 Bl4zeBoy  : MY CHIckens

17:51 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion i am the first to use the suggestions thing in the discord
18:00 Bl4zeBoy  : i am the first to use the suggestions channel
18:00 Zonelesi  : Probably
18:00 verzion   : yep saw
18:00 Bl4zeBoy  : do you like the idea?
18:01 Bl4zeBoy  : it represents how much someone is active on the server
18:01 Zonelesi  : My opinion, but I'm not sure it's a good idea
18:01 Zonelesi  : People could use it to show off, or it just gives off the idea that someone is superior to someone e;se
18:01 Zonelesi  : else*
18:02 Bl4zeBoy  : yeah you're right
18:02 Bl4zeBoy  : that's something we don't want: superiority
18:02 verzion   : perceptive Zonelesi.
18:02 Zonelesi  : Just my take on it, it could just be a nice thing on the server
18:03 Bl4zeBoy  : but what about the other idea verzion? the auction house
18:03 Bl4zeBoy  : with that there will be more money circulating
18:04 verzion   : I'm concerned about the economy and what that means for it.
18:04 Zonelesi  : dirt for 1m lol
18:04 Bl4zeBoy  : so you're concerned that the economy will become the only thing in the server?
18:05 Zonelesi  : I think Verzion is avoiding inflation.
18:05 Bl4zeBoy  : i actually agree with that
18:05 verzion   : I don't want to let players decide on items value
18:05 Zonelesi  : People could sell diamonds for $1
18:06 Bl4zeBoy  : maybe it could be automatic? like the server calculates the value
18:06 Zonelesi  : Shop does that for us
18:07 verzion   : no, blaze means autmatically assigning price in the auction house
18:07 verzion   : I know this server is missing ways for players to trade or sell between
18:07 Bl4zeBoy  : Omy days
18:07 Zonelesi  : Could do it the old fashioned way
18:07 Bl4zeBoy  : block clutch xDDDD
18:07 Zonelesi  : Just drop
18:08 verzion   : I'm looking at a player shop where the server can manage pricing, but it's not working yet.
18:08 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion!!!!! i had an ideaaaa
18:09 Bl4zeBoy  : chestshops! where someone could rent a plot like for 100 $ a week and they can have their shop
18:09 Bl4zeBoy  : and there could be /warp playershops
18:10 verzion   : as for the rank thing, I won't be promoting any form of clout chasing, whether it's money, ranks, tags, etc.
18:11 Zonelesi  : I am a bit of a communist, so I agree
18:11 Bl4zeBoy  : i am a socialist
18:11 verzion   : again, I'd need to have control over prices. But a player shop would be great
18:12 Bl4zeBoy  : yes and another idea: other ways to make money
18:12 Bl4zeBoy  : like quests
18:12 verzion   : yes, I've been working hard at that actually.
18:12 Zonelesi  : Job quests: "Am I a joke to you?"
18:12 verzion   : hm? :)
18:12 Bl4zeBoy  : i actually did one of those
18:12 Bl4zeBoy  : a job quest
18:13 verzion   : ah via /jobs quests ?
18:13 Zonelesi  : This baby zombie isn't doing damage either
18:13 Zonelesi  : Bruh
18:13 verzion   : they change every day, the quests
18:14 Bl4zeBoy  : i dug loads of dirt and the console said that i completed a quest
18:14 verzion   : and you got 1k i presume
18:14 Bl4zeBoy  : yes
18:15 Zonelesi  : That's just one branch ;-;
18:21 Bl4zeBoy  : hello!
18:26 Bl4zeBoy  : hallo
18:27 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion can you ban zombies?
18:28 Bl4zeBoy  : verzion are you afk?
18:28 verzion   : no
18:28 Bl4zeBoy  : ok good, a thing you should add to the shop is wood
18:29 Bl4zeBoy  : also how do i obtain a portal stone?
18:29 Zonelesi  : A really rare drop from redstone ore
18:30 Bl4zeBoy  : oh
18:30 verzion   : oooooo portal stone?
18:30 Bl4zeBoy  : yes
18:30 verzion   : rare af
18:30 verzion   : I want more rare af stuff on here
18:31 Zonelesi  : Imagine only being able to find wood in mesa biomes
18:31 Bl4zeBoy  : what how
18:31 Zonelesi  : It's a farce
18:32 Zonelesi  : Wood only gives 2-6 wooden pieces and you need 9 to craft a wooden plank.
18:32 Bl4zeBoy  : maybe a rare drop of ancient debris is another ancient debris?
18:32 Zonelesi  : MMorpg already does that
18:32 verzion   : you got double drops
18:33 Zonelesi  : I think a good set of mods to make this server harder is tough as nails, and epig siege mod.
18:33 Zonelesi  : epic*
18:36 Bl4zeBoy  : hallo
18:37 Bl4zeBoy  : DEBRIS
18:37 Bl4zeBoy  : debriiiiis
