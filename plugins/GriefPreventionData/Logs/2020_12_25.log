00:53 vanism    : I don't get why my mending diamond pickaxe doesn't mend
00:53 Zonelesi  : Are you getting xp?
00:54 vanism    : so I've got sword and chestplate with mending as well.
00:54 vanism    : they mend up, but after that I get xp instead of mending the pickaxe
00:54 Zonelesi  : Are you holding/wearing the item?
00:55 vanism    : not always. you need to be holding it right
