14:34 Zonelesi        : Sure
14:34 Bl4zeBoy        : now... i think that the bunny statue looks good, but.... what if there were more to it
14:35 Zonelesi        : More to it?
14:35 Bl4zeBoy        : yes. Its an idea from a mod that i played
14:36 Bl4zeBoy        : the statue is made of stone, right? so what if we made a secret underground bunker,
14:36 Bl4zeBoy        : with a secret entrance
14:36 Bl4zeBoy        : that is self sufficient!
14:36 Zonelesi        : Self sufficient?
14:36 Bl4zeBoy        : like we have farms and stuff down there
14:36 Zonelesi        : I guess we could try
14:37 Zonelesi        : Welcome back
14:37 Bl4zeBoy        : like the idea?
14:37 Zonelesi        : Yeah, but how will we do the entrance?
14:37 Bl4zeBoy        : i am good with the redstone
14:37 Bl4zeBoy        : and you are good at building
14:38 Bl4zeBoy        : oh hi!
14:38 Zonelesi        : Hai
14:38 Bl4zeBoy        : your base?

14:38 Bl4zeBoy        : noice
14:38 Zonelesi        : I think Ben is living here too
14:38 Bl4zeBoy        : so do you like the idea? i am good at redstone and i can make a toggle flip flop to activate
14:39 Zonelesi        : Like a secret button?
14:39 Bl4zeBoy        : an indefinite redstone signal with a button
14:39 Bl4zeBoy        : yes
14:39 Zonelesi        : I like that idea!
14:40 Bl4zeBoy        : so ill do the redstone and the digging... and you do the building, deal?
14:40 Zonelesi        : Deal.
14:40 Bl4zeBoy        : cool, ill start working
14:41 Bl4zeBoy        : oh yeah by the way, do you have any redstone?
14:41 Zonelesi        : Yeah
14:42 Zonelesi        : Where did you go?
14:42 Bl4zeBoy        : im at my base getting stuff
14:42 Zonelesi        : Alright
14:43 Bl4zeBoy        : so i definitely want to do it on the bunny statue
14:44 Bl4zeBoy        : we might need to disguise the future button with other buttons on the side of the bunny
14:44 Bl4zeBoy        : wb
14:44 Zonelesi        : Stone buttons are almost invisible anyway
14:44 BenBrigade      : thx
14:44 BenBrigade      : ☺
14:44 Bl4zeBoy        : yes but seing a redstone button in a place without buttons is sus
