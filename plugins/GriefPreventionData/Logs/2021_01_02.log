20:03 vanism    : heyyo
20:04 Zonelesi  : Heya
20:13 Zonelesi  : I was thinking of abandoning the rabbit empire
20:13 vanism    : oh?
20:13 Zonelesi  : It just doesn't seem right
20:14 vanism    : what's right then?
20:14 Zonelesi  : I like something a little more clean
20:14 Zonelesi  : So I'm making a sky base instead. And I'll eventually have to remove my previous base.
20:15 vanism    : clean-er? looks pretty spartan to me
20:15 vanism    : yea sometimes it doesn't click
20:16 vanism    : can I come see?
20:16 Zonelesi  : The sky base?
20:16 vanism    : no the rabbit emp
20:16 Zonelesi  : Sure
20:17 vanism    : is it far away from your base?
20:17 Zonelesi  : The sky base is.
20:17 vanism    : oh so you started a skybase already?
20:17 Zonelesi  : Yeah, I'll need a storage place so I can pack my bags.
20:18 Zonelesi  : I could probably try to make it look like ruins instead
20:25 vanism    : just 'saw' an invisible zombie on fire
20:25 vanism    : interesting
20:25 Zonelesi  : A bit sad but also interesting
20:28 vanism    : so many empty structures, kinda missing benches, tables, chairs, even plants. making it a bit more lived in somehow
20:29 Zonelesi  : I think it'd be too much to ask you to remove it all.
20:29 vanism    : you want it removed?
20:29 Zonelesi  : Yeah
20:29 Zonelesi  : Not yet though, I haven't got my stuff yet
20:31 Zonelesi  : 80s and 70s music videos are cheesy man
20:31 vanism    : 80s yes. almost eveything about the 80s
20:31 vanism    : I find the 70s still kinda cool
20:32 Zonelesi  : I guess they're interesting
