23:55 vanism    : xp?
23:56 LethalLuck: yep
23:56 vanism    : for what?
23:56 LethalLuck: Im trying to get all enchants on my equiptment
23:56 LethalLuck: Ive done both pickaxes shield axe and shovel
23:57 LethalLuck: but i need to get the misc enchants on my armor and need to finish my sword
23:57 vanism    : so you found a stronghold and end portal?
23:57 LethalLuck: Zone found end portal like 2-3 days ago
23:57 LethalLuck: we killed dragon remember
23:57 vanism    : ah yes
23:58 LethalLuck: I got an enderman farm for exp but i think the settings of sever having lowered view distance and such limits mob cap to only 50 endermen
23:58 vanism    : yes quite likely
23:58 LethalLuck: is slow but it gets the job done and until im stacked in equiptment i dont wanna fight end dragon for levels yet
23:59 LethalLuck: Right now i can get to level 30 after 3-4 50 enderman stacks
23:59 LethalLuck: only takes like 10-15 minutes max
23:59 vanism    : that's really good.
23:59 vanism    : I'm levelling up various mcmmo skills
23:59 LethalLuck: ill try to make spawn platform larger to give them more spawning locations but they'll still max at 50 cap
00:00 vanism    : like unarmed
