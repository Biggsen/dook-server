21:57 Posibility      : oop
21:57 verzion         : restarting now
21:59 verzion   : ah fresh
21:59 verzion   : can you smell it?
22:01 STra1z    : chunks are not loading
22:01 LethalLuck: it restart ?
22:03 verzion   : all good?
22:03 LethalLuck: lemme see
22:04 verzion   : seems fine to me
22:04 LethalLuck: waters still bugged
22:04 STra1z    : chunks are not loading to me
22:05 LethalLuck: ver can you tp to me
22:05 LethalLuck: so
22:05 LethalLuck: 8 blocks
22:05 LethalLuck: 7
22:05 LethalLuck: 6
22:05 LethalLuck: ?
22:06 verzion   : I don't think this is anything to do with server being bugged
22:06 LethalLuck: Any idea whats going on
22:06 LethalLuck: its not on a chunk border either
22:06 LethalLuck: 8 works
22:06 LethalLuck: its this line
22:06 LethalLuck: its just stops here
22:07 LethalLuck: like gravity tells it no
22:07 LethalLuck: pick that up
22:07 LethalLuck: look
22:07 LethalLuck: ??
22:07 verzion   : lol
22:07 LethalLuck: What kind of anomaly is this
22:08 verzion   : no idea
22:09 verzion   : it's next to your claimblock
22:10 verzion   : wonder if it's related?
22:10 LethalLuck: So my claim is stopping water from coming in
22:10 LethalLuck: Grief prevention maybe?
22:10 LethalLuck: has to be grief prevention measure
22:10 verzion   : possibly
22:10 verzion   : can you reduce the size?
22:10 LethalLuck: Weird that it doesnt reconize its me placing it
22:10 LethalLuck: ill unclaim
22:10 verzion   : ok
22:11 LethalLuck: i dont have water
22:11 LethalLuck: that should fix it tho
22:11 verzion   : yep
22:11 LethalLuck: how od
22:11 LethalLuck: odd
22:11 verzion   : learn something every day
22:11 LethalLuck: im gonna have to buy more land from store to protect my house and spawner lol
22:11 verzion   : it must be a grief prev function
22:12 LethalLuck: or it breaks i guess
22:12 LethalLuck: awkward but doable
22:12 LethalLuck: thanks
22:12 verzion   : np
22:12 verzion   : leave the water?
22:12 LethalLuck: i gjust got more
22:12 LethalLuck: np
22:12 Zonelesi  : Can I move spawners with pistons?
22:12 verzion   : don't know
22:12 LethalLuck: dont think so
22:12 STra1z    : is there a way to see where can i place nether portal so it doesnt connect to someone elses portal?
22:13 verzion   : you have to go far enough out. if you look it up, you can find how many blocks you'll need to be away.
22:15 Zonelesi  : Welcome!
22:15 verzion   : Welcome :)
22:15 MathWarrior_: Hello :)
22:15 MathWarrior_: is this server a paytowin server?
22:16 verzion     : no
22:16 MathWarrior_: :)
22:16 MathWarrior_: so annoying when owners sell /fly etc
22:16 Zonelesi    : I haven't spent a penny lol
22:16 verzion     : there's no store at the mo
22:16 verzion     : so I'm bleeding ;)
22:16 verzion     : nah jk
22:17 MathWarrior_: wait why do you ahve to unlock using every shop
22:17 verzion     : thats how it is.
22:17 Zonelesi    : Dang, why are people coming in here like some gordon ramsay of Minecraft servers
22:17 LethalLuck  : Just to give it a tiny grind
22:17 MathWarrior_: how would you even make money
22:17 LethalLuck  : 1000$ is literally nothing
22:17 MathWarrior_: im just confused thats all
22:17 MathWarrior_: how?
22:17 verzion     : Jobs and voting
22:17 Zonelesi    : This server is raw!
22:18 LethalLuck  : join a job
22:18 MathWarrior_: oh theres jobs
22:18 MathWarrior_: ty
22:18 verzion     : I'll look into more ways of earning money
22:18 verzion     : but I was tired of the server giving you everything.
22:18 verzion     : this one doesn't
22:19 verzion     : you can have two jobs
22:20 verzion     : and there is no /tp
22:20 verzion     : which is a dealbreaker for many
22:20 gman10777   : Is this American only server?
22:20 verzion     : no. didn't you ask that earlier today?
22:20 gman10777   : A + B + C = 10, what's A B C
22:21 verzion     : are you a bot?
22:21 Zonelesi    : 33.33333333
22:21 gman10777   : No
22:21 verzion     : :)
22:21 MathWarrior_: literally theres an infinite number of solutions to that
22:21 gman10777   : Proof?
22:21 LethalLuck  : ^^^
22:21 verzion     : a public server can't be American only
22:21 MathWarrior_: let a = 0.
22:21 MathWarrior_: Now, B + C = 10
22:21 LethalLuck  : numbers can become infinately small
22:21 LethalLuck  : a,b,c can all be different
22:21 MathWarrior_: Now you can see how b and c can be anything
22:22 LethalLuck  : = infinte solutions
22:22 gman10777   : No, proof?
22:22 MathWarrior_: let b = 5, and c = 5 also
22:22 LethalLuck  : We just explained it
22:22 gman10777   : Lethal shut up
22:22 MathWarrior_: b = 25, c has to be -35
22:22 gman10777   : Let Math do his thing
22:22 LethalLuck  : are you dumb lol
22:22 gman10777   : No you are
22:22 gman10777   : Because you didn't prove anything
22:22 gman10777   : Math is
22:22 LethalLuck  : infintely small numbers = infinte solutions
22:22 gman10777   : That isn't rigorous proof
22:23 verzion     : 8
22:23 LethalLuck  : having to show you one of infintie solutions is redundant
22:23 MathWarrior_: write a rigorous proof that 2 = 2 then
22:23 gman10777   : you're trolling me
22:23 gman10777   : okay, what's the definition of =
22:24 gman10777   : he was using = as ->
22:24 LethalLuck  : You want people to prove to you infinity by showing an example
22:24 LethalLuck  : that doesnt make sense
22:24 MathWarrior_: theres actually a formal term for the axiom that x = x but I can't remember what it's called
22:24 gman10777   : Something proves its own existence?
22:25 LethalLuck  : We're successfully letting him troll atm btw
22:25 gman10777   : I'm not
22:25 gman10777   : I'm having a discussion with Math
22:25 gman10777   : That's why I asked the question in the first place
22:25 gman10777   : I pressed tab and saw his name
22:25 gman10777   : I suppose you can say my question wait bait
22:25 gman10777   : but not in a trolly way
22:25 gman10777   : was bait*
22:26 Zonelesi    : Welcome back
22:26 MathWarrior_: but the relationship A = 10 - B is just a relationship. Because if B is in R, then 10-B must also be in R, so A is in R. Therefore, for any B in R, A is also in R and you have two real numbers that fit the equation when C is 0
22:26 SinisterX   : So me = confused ?
22:27 Zonelesi    : People arguing about math lmao
22:27 SinisterX   : Math is eh
22:27 LethalLuck  : Once he asked for proof of infinite it became a troll
22:27 gman10777   : No it's not "infinite"
22:27 MathWarrior_: lag
22:27 SinisterX   : How can one have proof of infinity if infinity is infinity?
22:28 Zonelesi    : Infinity is hard to comprehend
22:28 gman10777   : It's supposed to be generic to fit all cases
22:28 LethalLuck  : prove it fits ALL cases
22:28 SinisterX   : Lets not
22:28 gman10777   : He did
22:28 SinisterX   : xD
22:28 MathWarrior_: he wanted proof that a single equation with three unknowns had infinite solutions
22:28 LethalLuck  : good luck with infinity
22:28 gman10777   : Math literally proved it
22:28 SinisterX   : Lets not hurt my brain more then you have already xD
22:28 SinisterX   : Sound like a plan :P
22:29 MathWarrior_: i gtg
22:29 SinisterX   : Lag anyone?
22:29 Zonelesi    : Yep
22:30 SinisterX   : I'm getting slight block lag for some reason
22:30 Zonelesi    : I'm having that too
22:30 SinisterX   : mmm
22:31 SinisterX   : Gonna relog
22:31 SinisterX   : Test
22:31 SinisterX   : Ok i think im better
22:31 SinisterX   : Now
22:32 SinisterX   : Anyone have some diamonds for sell?
22:32 Zonelesi    : How much you want?
22:32 LethalLuck  : what you offering
22:32 SinisterX   : Need 8 but i know i don't have enough yet
22:32 SinisterX   : Just need a price to work towards
22:32 Zonelesi    : I can get it for you
22:32 SinisterX   : How much?
22:33 Zonelesi    : Just take it lol
22:33 Zonelesi    : Meet me at spawn if you want.
22:33 SinisterX   : :O
22:33 SinisterX   : I-
22:34 SinisterX   : Thanks
22:34 Zonelesi    : No worries :D
22:34 SinisterX   : I should be working right now but eh
22:35 Zonelesi    : I need silk touch lol
22:35 Zonelesi    : Can villagers trade that?
22:35 SinisterX   : Yeah
22:35 SinisterX   : If your lucky enough
22:35 Zonelesi    : Oh, ty
22:35 SinisterX   : brb
22:39 LethalLuck placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x7695, z1287
22:52 Zonelesi    : Welcome!
22:52 pixelpile19 : hi

23:07 Zonelesi    : Yeah, blazes don't seem to fight back
23:07 LethalLuck  : they dont attack or aggro me at all
23:07 pixelpile19 : ok ill mine for gold in bastions while you get concrete

23:49 Zonelesi    : Welcome back
23:51 pixelpile19 : lag?
23:51 Zonelesi    : A bit
23:51 Zonelesi placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x-395, z-1240
23:52 pixelpile19 : i keep timing out
23:52 Zonelesi    : Oh
23:52 Ice_Man_913 : me too
